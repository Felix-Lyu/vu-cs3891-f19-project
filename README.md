Data Visualization Project by Shunze Lyu and Mingqian Wu.

This is a two-part visualization that builds on the data from the NYPD on the city violent crime rate to present the component of violent crimes for each year from 2000-2018 and the trend of change in each category of violent crime.

A drop-down menu is available for the pie chart to explore the data for each individual year, while a hovering function is also provided to see the the category name and the exact contribution to the total number of violent crimes.
A hovering interaction is also available for the line charts to display the statistics of each year.
